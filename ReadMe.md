This application was made to streamline the workflow of my beloved uncle.

He performs data processing for a mailing company, part of his workflow is transforming fixed length files into .csv format.

## What's his problem?
Every time he gets a fixed length file, he has to open it up and replace any the quotation marks `"` with spaces, since they cause an issue when being converted to `.csv`

## FixedFileLength Cleaner
I told him I'd make him a simple app that he can use to do this automatically. The features requested were:
- Select a file to clean
    - Drag and drop preferred
- Output the fixed file into the same directory.
    - He suggested it could be the same file name with "\_cleaned" suffixed.

Short and simple idea

## Result
Made a portable app that streamlines this process.
